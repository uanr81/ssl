PRIME(1)                            OpenSSL                           PRIME(1)

NAME
       openssl-prime, prime - compute prime numbers

SYNOPSIS
       openssl prime [-help] [-hex] [-generate] [-bits] [-safe] [-checks]
       [number...]

DESCRIPTION
       The prime command checks if the specified numbers are prime.

       If no numbers are given on the command line, the -generate flag should
       be used to generate primes according to the requirements specified by
       the rest of the flags.

OPTIONS
       [-help]
           Display an option summary.

       [-hex]
           Generate hex output.

       [-generate]
           Generate a prime number.

       [-bits num]
           Generate a prime with num bits.

       [-safe]
           When used with -generate, generates a "safe" prime. If the number
           generated is n, then check that (n-1)/2 is also prime.

       [-checks num]
           Perform the checks num times to see that the generated number is
           prime.  The default is 20.
